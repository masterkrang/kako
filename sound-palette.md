# Sound Palette (is this the right term?)

## Sound inventory

- **consonants**: m k j p w b h g N ? n s tS S t f l "n "t nj (most used 20 across 451 languages)
- **vowels**: i a u E "o "e O o e a~ (most used 10 across 451 languages)

- Note: these are only sounds to choose from, not all of these have been introduced into the Kako language. These are simply a palette to choose from when constructing new words.

##Objectives

* To choose a group of consonants and vowels.
* The group of consonants and vowels should be suitable for building a vocabulary that is 10% or less the size of modern English.
* To have less consonants and vowels is better than having more, because you could always add more later as you need them. There is a minor exception to this.
* Do not choose too few consonants and vowels because this could result in having to use too many syllables or inflating the language in a needless way when creating new words.
* Choose sounds that are more likely to be understood by computers, robots, and artificial intelligence.

##Research

* Which consonants and vowels are most common across most languages?
* Which group of consonants could be chosen that will maintain continuity?
* Which sounds (consonant / vowel) are easiest for computers to understand?

##Notes

* frequency analysis seems the likely way to determine which consonants and vowels occur most frequently: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis
* apparent most occurring used letters in english: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu
