# Intro

kako is a simple, accessible, fun, and easy to learn language.

# Mission

here are some goals behind kako:

- create a language that is at least 10% the size of other widely spoken languages, like English and Chinese.
- to be ubiquitous (exist in as many places as it can).
- to be a low learning curve language.
- kako should be easy for children (and adults) to learn.
- like Esperanto, kako is a peaceful language, since communication is the basis of all relationships, people who can communicate more easily, will kill each other a lot less.
- to draw from the good parts of traditional languages, and ditch any of the anti-patterns.
- to create a convenient bridge language for people of different countries and languages. See "international auxilary language" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language
- to make it easier for humans and computers to speak to each other that we could live more happily together.
- to make translation much easier by allowing foreign languages to be translated into kako, that people fluent in kako can consume foreign content more easily.
- to eradicate undesirable aspects of languages. for example, hatred of people's, discrimination, sexism.
- to create a language that is highly reusable.
-- Notes: every syllable should be a self contained word and stand alone by itself as a frequently used word with valuable meaning. this is often referred to as a "root word" or "word cell". frome these words, new words could be constructed. this hase been referred to as "derivational word formation", and it is believed to be a reason why languages like Esperanto are successful.
