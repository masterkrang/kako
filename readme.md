# Mission

kako is a simple, accessible, fun, and easy to learn language.

here are some goals behind kako:

- create a language that is at least 10% the size of other widely spoken languages, like English and Chinese.
- to be ubiquitous (exist in as many places as it can).
- to be a low learning curve language.
- to draw from the good parts of traditional languages, and ditch any of the anti-patterns.
- to create a convenient bridge language for people of different countries and languages.
- to make it easier for humans and computers to speak to each other that we could live more happily together.
- to make translation much easier by allowing foreign languages to be translated into kako, that people fluent in kako can consume foreign content more easily.
- to eradicate undesirable aspects of languages. for example, hatred of people's, discrimination, sexism.
- to create a language that is highly reusable. every syllable should be a self contained word and stand alone by itself as a frequently used word with valuable meaning. frome these words, new words could be constructed.
