So this is not the most relevant number and in my opinion here is why: This number is likely to grow with time in any language. There are terms that spark up and become outdated very quickly. So, this number isn't super useful when trying to determine how many words are being used currently. Most of these words are obsolete. Trying to build a new language to account for all these useless words would be a nightmare. So, I'm mostly ignoring these numbers. What is useful is how many are being used now, and how many are relevant now?
