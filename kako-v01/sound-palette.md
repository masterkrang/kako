# Sound Palette (is this the right term?)

##Objectives

* To choose a group of consonants and vowels.
* The group of consonants and vowels should be suitable for building a vocabulary that is 10% or less the size of modern English.
* To have less consonants and vowels is better than having more, because you could always add more later as you need them. There is a minor exception to this.
* Do not choose too few consonants and vowels because this could result in having to use too many syllables or inflating the language in a needless way when creating new words.
* Choose sounds that are more likely to be understood by computers, robots, and artificial intelligence.

##Research

* Which consonants are most common across most languages?
* Which group of consonants could be chosen that will maintain continuity?
* Which sounds (consonant / vowel) are easiest for computers to understand?
